# Datasets

Location for code to process and provide datasets for the project. The project uses
[Huggingface Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) to read data.

Primarily there are two main kinds of datasets in the projects:

- **Passage**: Normal datasets to read story related datasets for training and inference.
- **DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)**: Working and long-term memory datasets 
based on [DPR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR).
